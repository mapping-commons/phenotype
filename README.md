# Mapping Commons for Phenotype Ontology Mappings

We focus here on collecting phenotype mappings between the following phenotype ontologies:

| Ontology | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Human Phenotype Ontology | An ontology of phenotypic abnormalities in Homo Sapiens |
| Mammalian Phenotype Ontology | An ontology of Mammalian phenotypes |
| Xenopus Phenotype Ontology | An ontology of phenotypic abnormalities in Xenopus |
| Zebrafish Phenotype Ontology | An ontology of phenotypic abnormalities in Zebrafish |

We want to build a reference mappings using the following methodology:

1. We collect and maintain "overestimation" mappings which are generated using automated tools, such as lexical matchers.
2. We maintain the official Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno) mappings, which define phenologs over EQ statements
3. We work with Model Organism Databases such as Xenbase and ZFIN to review mappings manually and correct them
